# Alicante Open Source - Frontend

This is the frontend for the Alicante Open Source project.

We are still not clear what we are going to do and what technology stack we are going to use.

The main idea is to do something similar to a blog, with a little more customization. We would like to develop the project completely from scratch to encourage contributions.

### Basic functionalities it should have:

- News section
- Events section (calendar, description, etc...)
- Repositories section to add repositories that may be interesting. Categorize them by complexity, technology stack, etc... A comment system for them would not be a bad idea.
- Resources / wiki section. A section to add our notes and tips both for contributing to projects and for using different technologies. A source of wisdom and experience for everyone.
- Login / user profile system. At least to have proof of authorship of everything that is done on the platform. Different integrations with Github could be studied.

### Some crazier ideas:

- A "democratic" system for adding content. Instead of the typical role system (Administrator / Moderator / User), design a system in which users are the ones who decide through votes if a news item, repository, etc... is published on the site.
- A system of "Upvotes" or "Favorites" to sort repositories by popularity.
- A ranking of member contributions.

## Feel free to contribute with your own ideas.
